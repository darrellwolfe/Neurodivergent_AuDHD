# Definitions

## The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
The DSM-5 is a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association that serves as the authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders. It contains criteria for hundreds of different disorders and is used by clinicians as a standardized reference for diagnosing mental health conditions.

## Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. It exists on a spectrum, meaning symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary significantly among individuals.

## Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. Symptoms typically manifest in two main categories: inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity.

## Neurodivergent (ND)
Neurodivergent refers to having cognitive functioning that deviates from societal norms. This includes conditions like ADHD, ASD, dyslexia, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The term is often used in a positive or neutral way to emphasize natural variations in human cognition.

Cleveland Clinic:
"The term “neurodivergent” describes people whose brain differences affect how their brain works. That means they have different strengths and challenges from people whose brains don’t have those differences. The possible differences include medical disorders, learning disabilities and other conditions. The possible strengths include better memory, being able to mentally picture three-dimensional (3D) objects easily, the ability to solve complex mathematical calculations in their head, and many more.

Neurodivergent isn’t a medical term. Instead, it’s a way to describe people using words other than “normal” and “abnormal.” That’s important because there’s no single definition of “normal” for how the human brain works.

The word for people who aren’t neurodivergent is “neurotypical.” That means their strengths and challenges aren't affected by any kind of difference that changes how their brains work."
